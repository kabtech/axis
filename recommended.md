#### [CloudReady](https://www.neverware.com/freedownload/) | convert almost any laptop to a Chromebook

If you have 'retired' a laptop and wish to make it a lightweight, accessible computer for your guests, consider converting it to [Chromium OS](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os) using CloudReady Home Edition. This is a highly stable, actively-maintained implementation of Chromium OS that parallels Neverware's Work Edition. Chromium OS is based on the Linux kernel and uses Google's Chromium browser as its principal user interface.

#### [Project Fi](https://fi.google.com/about/) | high-value / high function mobile plan

Google Project Fi is a network-of-networks mobile plan with extremely competitive pricing, exceptional coverage, and a group model that provides further  savings. Another extraordinary bonus is the international coverage: members enjoy coverage in 170+ countries; my family has put this to the test -- pretty nice when your mobile plan is welcoming you to another nation before you have even disembarked the plane. Moreover, their customer service has been consistently timely and effective. Go Fi!
