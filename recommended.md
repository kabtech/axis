#### [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/about/) | high-value / high function mobile plan

Google Fi is a network-of-networks mobile plan with extremely competitive pricing, exceptional coverage, and a group model that provides further  savings. Another extraordinary bonus is the international coverage: members enjoy coverage in 170+ countries; my family has put this to the test -- pretty nice when your mobile plan is welcoming you to another nation before you have even disembarked the plane. Moreover, their customer service has been consistently timely and effective. Go Fi!
