### CSF Maturity Model

**Policy (25%)**
- Do formal, up-to-date policies or standards exist that contain “shall” or “will” statements for each element of the requirement statement?
- Do the policies and standards that exist for each element of the requirement statement cover all major facilities and operations for the organizations and/or systems/assets in scope for the assessment?
- Are the policies and standards that exist for each element of the requirement statement approved by management and communicated to the workforce?

**Procedures (25%)**
- Do formal, up-to-date, documented procedures exist for the implementation of each element of the requirement statement?
- Do the procedures clarify where the procedure is to be performed, how the procedure is to be performed, when the procedure is to be performed, who is to perform the procedure, and on what the procedure is to be performed?
- Do the procedures address each element of the requirement statement across all applicable facilities, operations, and/or systems/assets in scope?
- Are procedures for the implementation of each element of the requirements statement communicated to the individuals who are required to follow them?

**Implemented (25%)**
- Is each element of the requirements statement implemented in a consistent manner everywhere that the policy and procedure applies?
- Are ad hoc approaches that tend to be applied on an individual or on a case-by-case basis discouraged?

**Measured (15%)**
- Are self-assessments, audits, and/or tests routinely performed and/or metrics collected to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the implementation of each element of the requirements statement?
- Are evaluation requirements, including requirements regarding the type and frequency of self-assessments, audits, tests, and/or metrics collection documented, approved, and effectively implemented?
- Does the frequency and rigor with which each element of the requirements statement is evaluated depend on the risks that will be posed if the implementation is not operating effectively?

**Managed (10%)**
- Are effective corrective actions taken to address identified weaknesses in the elements of the requirements statement, including those identified as a result of potential or actual information security incidents or through information security alerts?
- Do decisions around corrective actions consider cost, risk, and mission impact?
- Are threats impacting the requirements periodically re-evaluated and the requirements adapted as needed?
