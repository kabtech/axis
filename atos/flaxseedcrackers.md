### Flax Seed Crackers

This is my adaptation of a recipe I found online in the past. They are a pretty tasty way to get some flax seed into your diet, and at a much lower price than you will find at the store.

Ingredients

    1 cup flax seeds
    3 tbsp chia seeds
    1 cup water
    4 tbsp sunflower seeds
    3 tbsp minced craisins
    Â½ tsp salt (or to taste)
    1 packet stevia sweetner
    1 tbsp honey
    2 tsp cinnamon
    1 tsp vanilla

Instructions

Preheat oven to 200F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  
In a large bowl, soak flax and chia seeds in water for 15-20 minutes.  
Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well.  
Spread the mixture evenly on the lined baking sheet and bake at 200F for an hour and a half. Flip it over and bake for another hour and a half.  
When partially cooled, you can use a large chef's knife to cut the finished product into cracker sized squares.
