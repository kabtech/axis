### About

This site is developed and maintained by Kurt Abbott Bestul, long-time IT professional, technophile, and maker.

The site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and leverages a very simplified theme I developed via the [Jekyll site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) that is native to GitHub pages.
