### About

This site is developed and maintained by Kurt Abbott Bestul, long-time IT professional, technophile, and maker.

The site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses a visually spartan theme I developed employing the [Jekyll static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) engine that is native to GitHub pages sites.
