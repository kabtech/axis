### About

This site is developed and maintained by Kurt Abbott Bestul, long-time IT professional, technophile, and maker.

The site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses a visually spartan theme I developed employing the [Jekyll static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) engine that is native to GitHub pages sites.

> *When we meet aret&#234; in Plato, we translate it 'virtue' and consequently miss all the flavour of it. 'Virtue', at least in modern English, is almost entirely a moral word; aret&#234;, on the other hand, is used indifferently in all categories, and simply means excellence.  
Aret&#234; implies a respect for the wholeness or oneness of life, and a consequent dislike of specialization. It implies a contempt for efficiency -- or rather a much higher idea of efficiency, an efficiency which exists not in one department of life but in life itself.  
The Greeks, H.D.F. Kitto*
